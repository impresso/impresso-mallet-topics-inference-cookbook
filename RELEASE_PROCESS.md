## Release Workflow

### Overview

Releases follow these general steps:

1. **Prepare**: Review changes, update documentation, and test
2. **Document**: Write comprehensive release notes in the repository
3. **Commit**: Commit the release notes and any final version/documentation updates
4. **Tag**: Create a git tag for that exact release commit
5. **Publish**: Create a GitHub release from the committed release notes file
6. **Announce**: Notify users and update installation instructions

The key rule is to avoid writing or revising release notes after the release tag has
already been created. The release notes file should be part of the tagged commit so
that the repository state, the tag, and the published GitHub release all refer to the
same snapshot.

## Version Numbering

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes or breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backwards-compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards-compatible

### Examples

- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`: Breaking change (e.g., removed support for Python 3.10)
- `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`: New feature (e.g., added topic modeling pipeline)
- `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`: Bug fix (e.g., fixed S3 synchronization issue)

### Pre-release Versions

Pre-release versions can be tagged with additional labels:

- `1.1.0-alpha.1`: Early testing version
- `1.1.0-beta.1`: Feature-complete, testing phase
- `1.1.0-rc.1`: Release candidate, final testing

## Preparing a Release

### 1. Review Changes

```bash
# Compare with the last release tag
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Review file changes
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# Check what's changed in specific areas
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- lib/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- "*.mk"
```

### 2. Update Documentation

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes since the last release
- [ ] Update `README.md` if there are new features or changes to usage
- [ ] Review and update any outdated documentation
- [ ] Ensure all new features have documentation

### 3. Update Version References

Check and update version references in:

- [ ] `README.md` (usage examples, config file names)
- [ ] `AGENT.md` (example config filenames)
- [ ] Config filenames under `configs/` (the version is embedded in `MODEL_VERSION_TOPICS` / `RUN_VERSION_TOPICS`)

### 4. Test the Release

Run a smoke test to verify the pipeline environment end-to-end:

```bash
# Verify Python/Java environment
make setup

# Check that the Python installation and JPype are ready
make check-python-installation

# Dry-run inference for a single newspaper (no S3 writes)
make newspaper NEWSPAPER=<TITLE> \
  CFG=configs/config-topics-tm-mallet_infer_seed42_v2.0.1-multilingual_v2-0-1.mk \
  TOPICS_DRY_RUN_OPTION=--s3-output-dry-run \
  LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Creating Release Notes

Release notes should be prepared before the tag is created and committed together with
the final release-ready changes. The GitHub release description should then be created
from that committed file instead of being written separately in the web interface.

### Structure

Release notes should include:

1. **Overview**: Brief summary of the release
2. **Major Features**: Significant new functionality
3. **Technical Improvements**: Behind-the-scenes improvements
4. **Bug Fixes**: Issues resolved
5. **Breaking Changes**: Anything that breaks compatibility
6. **Migration Guide**: How to upgrade from previous version
7. **Known Issues**: Any known problems or limitations
8. **Dependencies**: New or updated dependencies
9. **Contributors**: People who contributed to this release

### Template

Use this template structure:

```markdown

### Generating Change Lists

Use git to generate lists of changes:

```bash
# List all commits
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Group by component
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- lib/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- models/tm/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- configs/
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline -- cookbook/

# Get commit authors
git shortlog v1.0.0..HEAD -sn

# Get file statistics
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --stat

# List new files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^A"

# List modified files
git diff v1.0.0..HEAD --name-status | grep "^M"
```

## Publishing a Release

### 1. Commit Release Notes and Final Metadata

Before tagging, ensure the release notes file and any final documentation or version
updates are committed:

```bash
git add README.md AGENT.md RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md
git add configs/
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.1.0"
```

This ensures the release notes are part of the exact commit that will be tagged.

### 2. Create Git Tag

> **Note:** The tag should land on `main`. If you have been working on a
> `version-X.Y` dev branch, merge it to `main` before tagging (or immediately
> after, then re-tag on the resulting merge commit):
>
> ```bash
> git checkout main
> git merge --no-ff version-X.Y -m "Merge version-X.Y into main for release vX.Y.Z"
> ```

```bash
# Create an annotated tag (on main)
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0: Description"

# Push the branch and tag together
git push origin main v1.1.0
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release

#### Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/impresso/impresso-mallet-topic-inference/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag you just created
4. Fill in the release title: `v1.1.0` or descriptive name
5. Paste the content of the committed `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md` file into the description
6. Check "Set as a pre-release" if applicable
7. Click "Publish release"

#### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# brew install gh  # macOS
# apt install gh   # Ubuntu

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create release from release notes file
gh release create v1.1.0 \
  --title "v1.1.0: Description" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md \
  --prerelease  # omit for stable release
```

Using `--notes-file` is preferred because it makes the GitHub release text come from
the same file that is stored in git and included in the tagged release commit.

### 4. Update Existing Release (if needed)

If you need to improve release notes for an existing release:

```bash
# Update release notes
gh release edit v1.1.0 \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.0.md

# Or via web interface:
# Go to the release page and click "Edit release"
```

This should be treated as a correction path, not the normal workflow. The normal path
is to finalize and commit the release notes before creating the tag.

## Post-Release Tasks

### 1. Update Main Branch

If the dev branch was not merged before tagging, merge it now and push:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff version-X.Y -m "Merge version-X.Y into main for release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main version-X.Y
```

### 2. Verify Configs Point to Released Model IDs

Confirm that the configs under `configs/` reference the correct `MODEL_VERSION_TOPICS`
and `RUN_VERSION_TOPICS`, and that the matching per-language model configs under
`models/tm/` exist and are correctly named.

### 3. Announce Release

- [ ] Notify team members
- [ ] Update any downstream pipeline configs that reference this inference run ID

### 4. Monitor for Issues

After release:

- Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports
- Check discussion forums or communication channels
- Be prepared to create patch releases if critical bugs are found

## Hotfix Releases

For critical bug fixes:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the release tag:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.1.1 v1.1.0
   ```

2. Make the fix and test thoroughly

3. Create a patch release:

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Hotfix: Description of critical fix"
   git push origin v1.1.1
   ```

4. Create release with focused release notes on the fix

5. Merge hotfix back to main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.1.1
   git push origin main
   ```
